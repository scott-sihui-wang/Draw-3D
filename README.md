# Draw 3D

## 1. Introduction

**Topics:** _Perspective Projection_, _Rendering_

**Skills:** _Visual C++_, _MFC_

This is the mid-term project for the course of `Programming Practices`. My final score for the course is **100/100**.

The original requirement for this project is to draw a picture of trees, houses and mountains with MFC. Meanwhile, I decided to take on further challenges to draw the picture in three dimensional and animated manners.

The professor was delighted with my work, and suggested that my work be included in the textbook.
